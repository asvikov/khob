# Work Process Agreement

## Important Guidelines

- Perform work strictly according to plan
- Before each iteration, agree on the proposed solution with code segments first
- After agreement, implement the solution
- After implementation, run tests. If tests return errors, check and fix them
- Wait for confirmation after completing implementation and testing
- Update progress in task list (if there is a task list)
- Mark completed tasks (if there is a task list)
- Agree on transition to the next iteration

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Review requirements and technical vision (@vision.md)
   - Break down tasks into manageable units
   - Create implementation plan with clear steps

2. **Design & Agreement Phase**
   - Propose solution approach before implementation
   - Discuss code structure and key components
   - Get approval on the planned approach

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement according to the agreed plan
   - Follow coding conventions from @vision.md
   - Write clean, maintainable code

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regression
   - Write new tests for implemented features
   - Fix any failing tests before proceeding

5. **Review & Confirmation Phase**
   - Submit for review and confirmation
   - Address any feedback
   - Get approval to move forward

6. **Task Management**
   - Update task progress regularly
   - Mark tasks as complete after full implementation and approval
   - Plan next iteration collaboratively

## Communication Protocol

- Always confirm before moving to next phase
- Share code snippets for discussion before full implementation
- Report blockers or issues immediately
- Document decisions and changes
